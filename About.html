              <p> Taylor Swift is the world's Biggest Popstar She is currently on her Eras World Tour.</p>
              <p> Taylor Swift was born on December 13, 1989 in Wyomissing Pennsylvania. Born to Andrea and Scott Kingsley Swift  .She moved to Hendersonville, Tennessee at age 13. 
              She was gifted with a talent in both in music and in poetry. On her 8th grade she won the national poetry competition.</p>
              <p> In Christmas 1997 she received her first guitar as a christmas gift from her mother. Since then, she became involved singing at public events. At age 16, 
                she signed a contract with Big Machine Records. That same year in 2006, she released her first single Tim Mcgraw, a song he dedicated to a country music legend.</p>
              <p> In the years that followed, she slowly moved towards pop. In 2009 her second album, Fearless was released and this was her first most popular album. 
               While Love Story was the first single of the album and was popular, the following song You Belong With Me became a massive hit. The song won the MTV Best Female Video in 2009 while the album 
              won a Grammy that same year.</p>
              <p> But her wins was just getting started. In the years that followed she became an instant superstar. Her second world tour, Speak Now Album World Tour was a sold out hit and was a chart topper in US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
             It was a magical album and some in the concert performances such as Enchanted felt like something out of a fairy tale. While Speak Now deals with the risks in a relationship, Red, the follow up album focuses on the aftermath of a break up. Songs like 
              We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together And 22 was about staying strong and coping a breakup while I Knew You Were Trouble and Holy Ground was all about 
              reminiscing the former relationship. The album tour that followed was also a sold out. </p>
            <p> From her Debut album to Red, her genre was country. But 1989, the fifth album changed all that. 
              Unlike the previous four, this era doesn't contain anything that's close to country. She went from being a  
              being country to full pop genre. However the theme also has to do with heartbreak. 1989 is about  moving to New York to move on
              as well as her dealing with ramped up media scrutiny.  Welcome to New Yor
